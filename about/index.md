## Fill Me In

#### WDI Project 1 - Week 3

‘Fill Me In’ is a two player puzzle game from my childhood traditionally played with pen and paper. Each player takes it in turn to draw a line between the dots. If a player creates a square, the square is filled the players colour then the player gets another go. The game is over when all possible lines have been drawn, and all squares have been shaded. The winner is the player with the most squares of their colour.

‘Fill Me In’ was built as my first project during the Web Development Immersive at General Assembly London. The project was presented on the Friday of week two and to be presented on the Tuesday of week three. The game was built with JavaScript, HTML and CSS.


## Ride With Me

#### WDI Project 2 - Week 7


‘Come Ride With Me’ is a responsive website for sharing lifts built as my second project at GA. A user may list a journey of their own in order to advertise a place in their car to other users. Or a user may search listed journeys to find a cheap ride between any two major cities.

## 7 Days of Sun

#### WDI Project 3 - Week 9


'7 Days of Sun' is a last minute travel and weather-report JavaScript Single Page Application which shows only sunny locations in the coming 7 days. A user can search for sun by viewing a world map populated with pins depiciting where it will be sunny for the next week.

A logged in user then may use the 'Sky Scanner' widget to select dates and then search the 'Sky Scanner' website to find the cheapest flight.

This project was built as the first group project as a team of three. The project was built with Ruby on Rails and included JavaScript, jQuery and Underscore.JS. The project made use of two APIs firstly the Google Maps API to plot the search results on a world map, and the forecast.io API to retrieve up to date weather conditions.


## Down To Go

#### WDI Project 4 - Week 12


‘Down To Go’ is an online dating app that provides users with a location based matching service as well as an instant messaging service. A user first registers, and from there can search for a venue. From there a user can see all other people attending and decide who they'd like to match with. If two users match with each other there is the option for them to progress to chatting with each other.

Back to back project weeks have been great fun but after the third project I think everyone was ready to start learning again. And this is where the real fun began…

Angular was the focus of the week, and to begin with I wasn’t thrilled. After all the time spent on Rails Angular almost felt like a step backwards in the sense that it wasn’t as simple as Ruby and to begin with it felt just a bit too fiddly. After a week of playing around with Angular I felt a lot more comfortable and was excited to have a  crack at the weekend homework of making an Angular site from scratch.

On the side I started looking into APIs for my final project as well as looking at sockets, even though it’d been less than a week since the last project the next one is only ever around the corner.

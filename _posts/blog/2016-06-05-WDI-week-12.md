I can’t believe it’s all over.

This week was the final project week and like expected it was most certainly the toughest week of WDI. My final project idea was to recreate Tinder, but rather than search for matches I was going to have the potential matches shown by event and location. So you’d state what venue or event you were going to, and from there you could begin swiping, matching and chatting.

Despite all my planning, the problems began immediately. An error in my authentication notes caused issues all weekend for me. I had spent most of my planning time playing with sockets, as I was sure that this would prove to be the biggest challenge waiting for me. I was wrong.

I began setting up the matching aspect of the app which proved to be much harder than I ever expected, the days rolled by and I was certain I wouldn’t have MVP by Friday. I must have had my Weetabix on Thursday morning as it was a day where all my bugs seemed to fall like dominoes. The impossible had happened and by Thursday evening I was cramming in as much styling to the bare bones as humanly possible.

Friday’s presentation was bitter-sweet, it went so well but I knew it would be the last time I’d be presenting to such a good group of friends.The evening was an alcohol fuelled affair which can only be described as a bit of a blur, so maybe the less said the better…

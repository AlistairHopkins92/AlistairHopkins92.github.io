This 12 week blog has an account of my 12 weeks at General Assembly and I can honestly say it’s been the best 12 weeks of my life. I’ve met some wonderful people and I’ve had the pleasure of being taught by the best instructor and teaching assistants.

### What We've covered...

We were given the task of writing down all the topics we'd covered in 12 weeks. Before we knew it the whiteboard was full and we were all truly amazed at how much we got through in 60days.

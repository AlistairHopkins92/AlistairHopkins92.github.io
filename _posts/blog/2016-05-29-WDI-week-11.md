Of all the weeks at WDI this was one of the strangest. The whole week was sorting out any loose ends as well as introductions to Jekyll and Grunt. We had a few a field trips mixed into week 11, we went to visit Moo, who are a company that sell business cards, as well as the Government Digital Services (GDS).

All the talk this week was focused on the big final project as well as how this wonderful experience is sadly coming to an end. On Friday project planning begun. Although I’d given it a lot of thought I was determined not to make the mistake of not planning enough, I didn’t want a repeat of project 2.

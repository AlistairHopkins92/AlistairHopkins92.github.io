It’s week 4 and the pace hasn’t slowed in the slightest, after four or five days of independant work it's strange to get back into the flow of lessons again. Monday was our introduction to Ruby, we spent the day looking at arrays, control flow and hashes.

Monday evening homework was definitely one of my favourites, we were given a basic subway map and we had to use control flows to calculate the minimal number of stops between any two stations. I’m not sure what it was but something clicked and for the first time ever I’d finished a homework before 9pm! It was a day of firsts, I felt bad finishing early so I spent an hour or so drying up my code and offering a hand to anyone who needed it.

The basic tube map:

Tuesday we were given a fun lab, we had to create a game of 'pling plang plong', the rules are similar to the game 'fizz buzz'. The point of the game is you have to count, and any multiple of 3 must be replaced with the word 'pling', multiples of 5 'plang' and multiples of 7 'plong'. Any number with common denominators 3 and 5 would be 'pling plang' and so on.

The challenge was to write the best game of 'pling plang plong' as a group. Easy we thought. Then after a while it hit us, what would make our game the 'best'? First thoughts were how dry our code would be maybe how little code we could write to make it work.
After our code was submitted, we were told that our code was going to be tested for speed...

The speed tests became very competative and the class soon decended into a room of noise and neolithic behaviour. Once the excitement had died down we examined the results and each others code to discuss why some teams had faster running times than others.

The rest of the week was spent looking deeper into Ruby and we were introduced to Sinatra. Most of the homeworks for the week were relatively painless, it was nice to have a few homeworks that didn’t involve making a calculator or a game of tic-tac-toe!

The week left me feeling confident in my ability, the idea of learning a new language so soon after getting to grips with javaScript and JQuery seemed like a new mountain to climb. Ruby was fine though, some new syntax but nothing to difficult to get your head around.
4 weeks down, 8 to go. How am I a third of the way through already?!

It’s week 4 and the pace hasn’t slowed in the slightest. Monday was our introduction to Ruby, we spent the day looking at arrays, control flow and hashes. Monday evening homework was definitely one of my favourites, we were given a basic subway map and we had to use control flows to calculate the minimal number of stops between any two stations. I’m not sure what it was but something clicked and for the first time ever I’d finished a homework before 9pm! It was a day of firsts, I felt bad finishing early so I spent an hour or so drying up my code and offering a hand to anyone who needed it.

The rest of the week was spent looking deeper into Ruby and we were introduced to Sinatra. Most of the homeworks for the week were relatively painless, it was nice to have a few homeworks that didn’t involve making a calculator or a game of tic-tac-toe!

The week left me feeling confident in my ability, the idea of learning a new language so soon after getting to grips with javaScript and JQuery seemed like a new mountain to climb. Ruby was fine though, some new syntax but nothing to difficult to get your head around.
4 weeks down, 8 to go. How am I a third of the way through already?!

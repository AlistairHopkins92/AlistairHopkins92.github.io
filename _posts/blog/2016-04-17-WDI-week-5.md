It’s week 5 and we’re doing databases with SQL and to be perfectly honest it didn’t strike me as the most exciting topic when I first heard that’s what we’d be covering. A week on I’m still not loving databases, but at least now I can appreciate why they are useful.

After a few days of SQL and databases we started to look at CSS frameworks and SASS. After half an hour of getting to grips with bootstrap I’m already looking at a webpage that looks more professional than anything I produced in my first 4 weeks of WDI. Thursday was dedicated to encryption using a Ruby gem called BCrypt, now I’m sat looking at a well styled website (with the help of bootstrap) with with a user registration and login. Nearly half way through the course and I’m starting to feel like I’m half way to becoming a junior developer.

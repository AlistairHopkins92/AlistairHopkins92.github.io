Monday and Tuesday of week three were the final days of out first individual project, with project presentations on Tuesday afternoon. I found these two days the most rewarding of the course so far. It was a nice feeling to look down at my work each evening and see the game slowly take shape.

My presentation on Tuesday afternoon went really well despite a little hiccup where I’d caught a last minute bug, fixed it, then forgotten to push my last minute changes to Heroku.

Wednesday morning we had a little lecture of the history of the internet which was a nice way to return to lessons after projects, and then we were thrown back into the deep end with Node. Wednesday afternoon and Thursday were dedicated to node and the 7 restful routes. This was probably the first time I felt well and truly out of my comfort zone on the course and the homework of making a calculator using node only conjures up bad memories for me. I’m sure I’ll look back in a week and it’ll all seem like second nature to me.

Friday was a bit of a disaster but fun, no internet at the office meant that we were given a strange mix of challenges to complete throughout the day. One of the best was an interview problem that apple used to give candidates, where they were told they had 30 minutes to make the american flag using HTML and CSS  without using the internet.

An observation from the end of week 3 - the homework for the second day and how taxing I found it seems a million miles away from where I am now. The phrase “CSS and Chill” is commonplace and is used to describe the styling of projects done between 9pm and 10pm. It’s a rewarding feeling to look back on something I found so slow and frustrating, to now feeling like it’s second nature almost, and all in the space of two weeks!

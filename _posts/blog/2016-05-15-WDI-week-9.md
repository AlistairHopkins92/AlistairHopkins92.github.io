Week 9 was all about the group project. My group had found a nice weather API and decided to use it to find the locations in the world which would gaurente the user 7 days of uninterrupted sunshine.

From the get go we encountered many issues working as a group that we didn’t face as individuals, as a group we elected to have meetings twice a day to make sure we were all moving in the same direction as well as using it as an opportunity to help each other with any issues facing us.

During this group project week I learnt a lot more about git and github, it was the first time on the course where I’d faced merge conflicts when pushing to a group repository. It was nice to see how the  others in my group tackled problems differently. Rather than playing to our strengths we decided to do the complete opposite which might seem like madness, but as a group we decided it’d be more beneficial from a learning point of view for all of us to focus on an area we felt uncomfortable with.

The final product:

Trying to present a project between three of us was an interesting experience, and for all the presentation planning we did it seemed like we’d strayed away from the plan within the first 30 seconds of the presentation. Overall the presentation went really well and as a group we were all pleased and proud of what we had produced.

This week was project number two and it’s been a very very stressful week. I decided to make a lift sharing website where a user could log in and register free spaces in their car, or they could ask to take a free space in someone else’s car.

This project had a lot of hiccups, and before I knew it I had a bug list longer than my arm. The first big mistake, not enough planning. After finishing week 6 on such a high I felt ready to jump right in and before I knew it I was surrounded by bugs. Another major stress for this week was trying to incorporate the Facebook OAuth login into my website, if I’d known from day 1 of the project how difficult it’d be I might have thought twice about including it.

The project went right down to the wire, I eventually got my Facebook login working but could have done with an extra day or two to improve on the styling. With every project an extra few days would have been nice, but compared to the first project I was proud that I had pushed my self so hard and tackled something I felt was way out of my comfort zone.

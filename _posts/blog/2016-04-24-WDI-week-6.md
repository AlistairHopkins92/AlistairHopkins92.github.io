This was the week we finally looked at Rails, as much as I loved ruby, rails was great. What would take hours in Ruby and Sinatra was a walk in the park with Rails, I only wish I’d known about it sooner.

As a demonstration to the power of rails, our instructor Alex set himself the challenge of seeing how quickly he could make a library style website, where a user could add, list, edit and delete books. We were asked how long we thought it’d take and guesses were in the ball park of 10 to 20 minutes. He was done in a little over two minutes. Mind Blown.

We also built on the BCrypt stuff we’d looked at last week with Devise and OAuth. OAuth looked like a particularly impressive tool, and with project 2 around the corner I thought it’d be great to use some form of Facebook or gmail login for my project.

Week 8 like most weeks straight after a project this week was a bit of a slug, before we knew it we were straight back into lessons and a crash course introduction to APIs in Express. With this came a transition from Rails back to javascript.

One of the first things we looked at was the google maps API as well as the Transport for London traffic cameras API, using these APIs we populated a map of London with markers showing every traffic camera which would then load a live image of the road. The transition back to javaScript after a few weeks on Ruby felt a bit strange. We were then introduced to Mongo databases as well as Mongoose.

Just as I was getting the hang of how APIs worked the third project had already come around. This project was our first group project and probably the most challenging project. We were split into groups of three and told we could make whatever we wanted as long as it used some form of API. We spent the weekend planning, wireframing and looking at initial tasks such as the authorisation.

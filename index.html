<p>I'm Alistair Hopkins and welcome to my website. Thanks for taking your time to have a look around. This website started as a bit of a blog for my time learning to code at General Assembly, and since then has been converted into a bit of a portfolio of my projects to date.</p>

<p>So a bit about myself... From an early point I'd persued an accedemic route to life, completing my A-Levels and then a BSc in Mathematics at York University. During my time at University I worked with a friend making an iOS app for a Quantity Surveying company, this was my first proper taste of coding. When it came to graduation and deciding what to do with my degree I was lost. From here I spent a year working in bars and saved up for a plane ticket to New Zealand and spent 4 months travelling and deciding where to go next.</p>

<p>During my time in New Zealand I spent my quieter days playing around with some C++ and watching endless lists of online tutorials. This was the point where I realised a career in finance or teaching maths weren't for me. It was time to persue what I enjoyed. So while I was away I signed myself up for the General Assembly Web Development bootcamp. From there it went from booking a flight home, to phone interviews, to completing piles of pre-work, to starting the course all in the Space of a month.</p>

<p>And here I am 12 weeks later, graduated and looking for my first position at my dream job.</p>

<p><b>tl;dr?</b><br> I'm an aspiring developer and a Mathematics graduate with a keen interest in solving complex problems and making things work. I enjoy working as an individual as well as part of a team, Iâ€™m currently looking for opportunities to join a team of like minded developers to continue my personal development.</p>
